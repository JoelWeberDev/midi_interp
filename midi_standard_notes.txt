# Notable Notes about the MIDI standard


# Data input standards and conventions
    ## General track format
        MThd <length of header data>
        <header data>
        MTrk <length of track data>
        <track data>
        MTrk <length of track data>
        <track data>
        ...

    ## Header input order:
        a. <chunk type> = MThd = 4d 54 68 64 = 01001101010101000110100001100100
        b. <length of header data>(32-bits); lsb on the left; this is the number of bytes that will follow 
        c. <format>(16-bits) 
            0-the file contains a single multi-channel track
            1-the file contains one or more simultaneous tracks (or MIDI outputs) of a sequence
            2-the file contains one or more sequentially independent single-track patterns 
        d. <ntrks>(16-bits) number of tracks in the file
        e. <division>(16-bits) meanings of delta times. See sources for more details

    ## Track format and order:
        1. track header: a stream of MTrk events
            a. <chunk type>(32-bits) = MTrk = 4d 54 72 6b = 01001101010101000111001001101011
            b. <length of header data>(32-bits); lsb on the left; this is the number of bytes that will follow 
            c. <MTrk event> one or more
                I. <delta-time>(16-bits); a delta time of 0 is used at the start and for simultaneous events; delta times are typically fractions of a beat
                II. <event>
